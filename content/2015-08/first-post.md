Summary: Introduction and topics in this blog.

Hello world!

The topics of this blog gravitate around reproducible computing and
scientific computing in python, taking examples from the field of
single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy.

The technical posts will be written
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
(and ipython) to facilitate reproducibility.
For readers new to project Jupyter I put here some references:

## Technical bits

This blog is generated by [pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) using
vanilla *notmyidea* theme and the
[ipynb plugin](https://github.com/danielfrg/pelican-ipynb)
to support Jupyter notebooks. Equations are rendered with
[render_math plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/render_math)
and the sources of this blog are on [github](https://github.com/tritemio/smbits).
