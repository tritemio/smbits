</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>In a <a class="reference external" href="http://tritemio.github.io/smbits/2016/02/19/fretbursts/">previous post</a>, I introduced
<a class="reference external" href="http://tritemio.github.io/FRETBursts/">FRETBursts</a>, an open source
burst analysis software for single-molecule <span class="caps">FRET</span> (smFRET) data with a strong
focus on reproducibility.
Today, I talk about a new service (based on <a class="reference external" href="http://MyBinder.org">MyBinder.org</a>)
which allows running <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks#run-online">FRETBursts on-line</a>,
with zero&nbsp;installation.</p>
<p>With this new service you can try FRETBursts without the need
to install anything (i.e. python) on your computer.
All you need is clicking the following button, which will open a new instance
of the FRETBursts environment on the&nbsp;cloud:</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://mybinder.org/repo/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks"><object data="http://mybinder.org/badge.svg" type="image/svg+xml">button launch binder</object></a>
<p>The previous button will open a new page in your browser
showing the <a class="reference external" href="http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html#notebook-dashboard">Jupyter Dashboard</a>.
There, in the <em>notebooks</em> folder, you will find multiple FRETBursts notebooks
for different kind of analysis. All you have to do is pick one and run&nbsp;it.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you are new to Jupyter Notebook start by clicking on the <em>First Steps</em>&nbsp;notebook.</p>
</div>
<p>In the future, publications using FRETBursts will hopefully also deposit
the data on a public repository (such as <a class="reference external" href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="https://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>).
This will enable anybody to replicate
the computations in a paper simply using FRETBursts on the&nbsp;cloud.</p>
<div class="section" id="features-and-limitations">
<h2>Features and&nbsp;Limitations</h2>
<p>At the moment, the notebooks available in the on-line service are
the same ones included in FRETBursts source repository.
When ran unmodified, they will download a sample data file
and run the analysis on it.
You can also use your own data file which needs to be uploaded first
(see the <em>First Steps</em> notebook). You can even upload your own FRETBursts
notebook, if you happen to have one&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>A current technical limitation
(that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/96">will be soon fixed</a>)
is that the <strong>Upload</strong> button on the dashboard works only form small files (&lt;<span class="caps">35MB</span>).
For bigger files, you have to upload the data somewhere on the internet
and then download it to the server
(see explanation in the <em>First Steps</em>&nbsp;notebook).</p>
<p>As a final caveat, note that sessions on MyBinder are not permanent
(they are deleted after 1 hour of inactivity).
Therefore, if you modify a notebook and want store it for reference or future
use, please remember to download it on your own&nbsp;computer.</p>
<p>Feedback and questions are more than welcome.
Please open a
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/issues">GitHub Issue</a>
to discuss anything related to this&nbsp;service.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="behind-the-scenes">
<h2>Behind the&nbsp;Scenes</h2>
<p>Even though MyBinder is an incredibly sophisticated service, setting it
up is incredibly easy. So easy that anybody (either using FRETBursts or not)
can setup a similar service to complement a publication, for&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>Starting from a repository containing a bunch of notebooks,
all I had to do was adding
a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts_notebooks/blob/master/environment.yml">text file</a>
with the list of (<a class="reference external" href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/">conda</a>) packages to be installed on the server
(and that file was mostly auto-generated). Then, MyBinder.org did the&nbsp;magic.</p>
<p>Here, I want to briefly highlight some pre-conditions that made possible
building such an incredible&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>First and foremost it&#8217;s open source.
Like continuous integration (an automated testing infrastructure),
the service that allows to run FRETBursts on-line exists only because
all the FRETBursts software dependencies (python, jupyter,
numpy, scipy, lmfit, matplotlib, etc&#8230;) are free an open source.
If FRETBursts were written in <span class="caps">MATLAB</span>, for example, due to licensing cost,
running a continuous integration service or a service like MyBinder.org
to execute <span class="caps">MATLAB</span> code on the cloud would have been prohibitively expensive.
Moreover, since it would have been a closed platform, it would not have
received the sort or contributions (form individual and companied across the
world) that these software have. The technical (and ethical) superiority
of open source software for scientific computing cannot be understated
(see <a class="reference external" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2015.04.002">this paper</a>
for more detailed&nbsp;argumentations).</p>
<p>Second,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/commit/f4de178f834f1341f01a5c494ac659537c70298d">early</a>
in development of FRETBursts,
I choose to base the execution on Jupyter Notebooks
(at the time called IPython Notebook).
This allowed me to focus on developing FRETBursts as a library,
avoiding wasting time building GUIs or command line interfaces
that can easily become bloated or obsolete.
On the contrary, the notebook interface represents a semi-graphical
interface which is good enough even for non-programmers.
Notebooks are also quite good for storing full analysis workflows,
drastically simplifying the way we share analysis details and&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>Third, and most importantly, Jeremy Freeman and collaborators built MyBinder,
a service to execute on the cloud any Jupyter notebook contained
in a GitHub repository.
This was possible by recent developments in the Jupyter project
(e.g. JupyterHub), together
with a clever use of modern cloud technologies (docker + kubernetes).
For an introduction to MyBinder in scientific computing
see <a class="reference external" href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-mybinder.html">this interesting post</a>
from Titus&nbsp;Brown.</p>
<p>Synergies made possible by open source technologies <strong>plus</strong> skillful
individuals can make&nbsp;miracles.</p>
<p>In other words, with FRETBursts, we really stand on giant&#8217;s&nbsp;shoulders!</p>
